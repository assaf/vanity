title: Configuring the Playground

Vanity will work out of the box on a default configuration.  Assuming you're using Redis on localhost, post 6379, there's nothing special to do.

Database connection information is loaded from @config/vanity.yml@, based on the current environment (@RACK_ENV@ or @RAILS_ENV@). Example:

<pre>
development:
  adapter: redis
  connection: redis://localhost:6379/0
test:
  collecting: false
production:
  adapter: mongodb
  database: analytics
</pre>

If there's no configuration file and the application does not create a connection explicitly, Vanity will default to the Redis instance running on @localhost@ at port 6379.

The available database adapters are:

* +redis+ -- This adapter is used by default. Available options are connection and password. host, port, database (defaults to 0) options are available, but deprecated.
* +mongodb+ -- Available options are host, port, database (defaults to "vanity"), username and password.
* +active_record+ -- Uses existing ActiveRecord configuration, by you can over-ride by supplying different options. To pick different underlying adapter, set +active_record_adapter+.

Available configuration options are:

|_. name      |_. Is all about ...                      |_. Default      |
| load_path   | Directory containing experiment files   | experiments    |
| logger      | This should be obvious                  | default/Rails  |
| collecting  | False if you won't want data collected  | true           |

When "running under Rails":rails.html, Vanity defaults to using the Rails logger, locates the load_path relative to Rails root, uses the @config/vanity.yml@ configuration file (if present) and turns collection on only in production mode.

If you run a different setup, use the playground object to configure Vanity.  For example:

<pre>
Vanity.playground.load_path = "exp"
Vanity.playground.establish_connection "redis://db.example.com"
</pre>
