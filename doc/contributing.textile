To make life easier, you can use Bundler with the included Gemfile to load all the necessary development dependencies.

For example, to install all the dependencies and run the test suite for the first time:

<pre>
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake test
</pre>


h3(#doc). Documentation

Documentation is written in "Textile":http://redcloth.org/textile/writing-paragraph-text/, and converted to HTML using "Jekyll":http://jekyllrb.com/.
