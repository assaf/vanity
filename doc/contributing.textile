h3(#contributing).  How To Contribute

Pick on an "open issue":http://github.com/assaf/vanity/issues, "experimental feature":experimental.html, suggestion from the "Google Group":http://groups.google.com/group/vanity-talk, or whatever you feel like contributing.

To contribute new code/changes:
# "Fork the project":http://github.com/assaf/vanity
# Please use a topic branch to make your changes, it's easier to test them that way
# Fix, patch, enhance, document, improve, sprinkle pixie dust
# Tests. Please. Run rake test, of if you can, rake test:all (see below)
# Send a pull request on GitHub

Bonus points for helping improve the documentation, writing some examples, and adding more test coverage.


h3(#building). Building From Source

Vanity is tested against multiple Ruby implementations, and a variety of database engines. To make life easier, we use "RVM":http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/ and "Bundler":http://gembundler.com/ to set up the test/development environment.

To test Vanity for the first time under whichever Ruby implementation you're currently using:

<pre>
$ rake test:setup
$ rake test
</pre>

To test Vanity with all supported adapters, or a specific adapter:

<pre>
$ rake test:adapters
$ rake test:adapters[redis]
</pre>

To test Vanity with all supported Ruby implementations, or a specific implementation:

<pre>
$ rake test:rubies
$ rake test:rubies[1.9.2]
$ # or
$ rvm 1.9.2@vanity rake test
</pre>

Before making a release, we run the full suite of tests with all supported Rubies/adapters. Help make Vanity better by running these tests with your changes:

<pre>
$ rake test:all
</pre>

If you have RVM installed, @rake test:rubies@ will install all the supported Ruby implementations and populate the @vanity@ gemset for you. To test all supported adapters, you will also need to install Redis, MongoDB and Sqlite3. If working on the Mac, you can easily install them using "Homebrew":http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew.

To package Vanity as a gem and install on your machine:

<pre>
$ rake install
</pre>


h3(#doc). Documentation

Documentation is written in "Textile":http://redcloth.org/textile/writing-paragraph-text/, and converted to HTML using "Jekyll":http://jekyllrb.com/.

API reference is "RDoc":http://rdoc.sourceforge.net/doc/index.html, converted to HTML using "Yardoc":http://yardoc.org/. 

To build and view documentation:

<pre>
$ rake docs
$ open html/index.html
